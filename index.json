In this paper, we propose to explicitly address different kinds of abnormal events by developing a two-stream fusion approach that integrates both geometry and image texture information. To be concrete, we firstly propose to utilize an object detector to divide the abnormal events into two catalogues:abnormal human behaviors and abnormal objects. For the detection of abnormal human behaviours, we exploit a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) which considers both spatial and temporal domains to capture the geometrical features from human pose graphs. The extracted geometric feature embeddings are further adapted with a clustering step to cluster the temporal graphs and output normality scores. For the detection of abnormal objects, the obtained from the object detector are reused to assist with generating normality scores of possible anomalies. Finally, a late fusion is performed to integrate normality scores from both screams for final decision. The experimental results on the datasets of UCSD PED2 and ShanghaiTech Campus demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.","tags":[],"title":"A Two-Stream Information Fusion Approach to Abnormal Event Detection in Video","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robail Yasrab","Zeyu Fu","Lior Drukker","Lok Hin Lee","He Zhao","Aris T Papageorghiou","J.

Current diagnosis of FAS is typically done by identifying a set of facial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination. Anatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is important to detect the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This imaging application is characterized by large variations in data appearance and limited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based heatmap regression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images assume availability of large datasets and are therefore not well-suited for this application. To address this restriction, we develop a new regularized transfer learning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network learned on large facial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which focuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach regularizes the model behavior. It explicitly reuses the rich visual semantics of a domain-similar source model on the target task data as an additional supervisory signal for regularizing landmark detection optimization. Specifically, we develop four regularization constraints for the proposed transfer learning, including constraining the feature outputs from classification and intermediate layers, as well as matching activation attention maps in both spatial and channel levels. Experimental evaluation on a collected clinical imaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve model generalizability under limited training samples, and is advantageous to other approaches in the literature.","tags":[],"title":"Facial Anatomical Landmark Detection Using Regularized Transfer Learning With Application to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxing Yang","Yang Xian","Zeyu Fu","Syed Mohsen Naqvi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"f7b9290189e66072b0760fad05c9f619","permalink":"https://zeyufu.github.io/publication/fusion2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fusion2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Video anomaly detection aims to recognise and analyse the video sequences to classify the normal and abnormal frames. This technology can efficiently reduce the human labour to discover the anomalies in surveillance systems and is widely applied in financial, public security and transport sectors.

Besides, the computational cost of the classification model would be required as low as possible.

Real-world scenarios HAR implementations is difficult because of the gap between Deep Learning data requirements and what the CCTV-based frameworks can offer in terms of data recording equipments. We propose to reduce this gap by exploiting human poses provided by the OpenPose, which has been already proven to be an effective detector in CCTV-like recordings for tracking applications. Therefore, in this work, we first propose ActionXPose:a novel 2D pose-based approach for pose-level HAR. ActionXPose extracts low- and high-level features from body poses which are provided to a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network for the classification. We also provide a new dataset, named ISLD, for realistic pose-level HAR in a CCTV-like environment, recorded in the Intelligent Sensing Lab. ActionXPose is extensively tested on ISLD under multiple experimental settings, e.g. Dataset Augmentation and Cross-Dataset setting, as well as revising other existing datasets for HAR. ActionXPose achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, very high robustness to occlusions and missing data, and promising results for practical implementation in real-world applications.","tags":[],"title":"2D Pose-Based Real-Time Human Action Recognition With Occlusion-Handling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeyu Fu","Jianbo Jiao","Michael Suttie","J.

Current methods related to this task often leverage the power of deep neural networks, while a major challenge in fine tuning such models in medical applications arises from insufficient number of labeled samples. To address this, we propose to regularize the knowledge transfer across source and target tasks through cross-task representation learning. The proposed method is demonstrated for extracting facial natomical landmarks which facilitate the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The source and target tasks in this work are face recognition and landmark detection, respectively. The main idea of the proposed method is to retain the feature representations of the source model on the target task data, and to leverage them as an additional source of supervisory signals for regularizing the target model learning, thereby improving its performance under limited training samples. Concretely, we present two approaches for the proposed representation learning by constraining either final or intermediate model features on the target model. Experimental results on a clinical face image dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach works well with few labeled data, and outperforms other compared approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Task Representation Learning for Anatomical Landmark Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zeyu Fu","Federico Angelini","Jonathon Chambers","Syed Mohsen Naqvi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"4e1c716ba858f00bc01a67a08dc2f3e1","permalink":"https://zeyufu.github.io/publication/ieee-tmm2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ieee-tmm2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a multi-level cooperative fusion approach to address the online multiple human tracking problem in a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter framework. The proposed fusion approach consists essentially of three steps. First, we integrate two human detectors with different characteristics (full-body and body-parts), and investigate their complementary benefits for tracking multiple targets. For each detector domain, we then propose a novel discriminative correlation matching model, and fuse it with spatio-temporal information to address ambiguous identity association in the GM-PHD filter. Finally, we develop a robust fusion center with virtual and real zones to make a global decision based on preliminary candidate targets generated by each detector. This center also mitigates the sensitivity of missed detections in the generalized covariance intersection fusion process, thereby improving the fusion performance and tracking consistency. Experiments on the MOTChallenge Benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved performance over other state-of-the-art RFS-based tracking methods.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Level Cooperative Fusion of GM-PHD Filters for Online Multiple Human Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
